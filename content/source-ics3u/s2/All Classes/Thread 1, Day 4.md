## Agenda
1. Portfolio: [[Sharing Evidence]]
	- How to best share evidence of progress against our [[Learning Goals|course learning goals]].
2. Setup: [[Hardware Inventory]]
3. Concept: [[Code Style Conventions]]
4. Discussion: [[Structures#Exercise|Structures Exercise]] 
	- How do we decide what properties should be included in a structure?
	- How should properties be named?
	- What data types should we use?
	> [!TIP]
	> 
	> Here is a video that recaps what we discussed in class for this agenda item – regarding [[Defining and Using Structures|the questions we should consider when authoring a structure]].
1. Exercise: Computed Properties
	- As a class and then in pairs, we'll [take some measurements to examine human-body ratios](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-body-ratios/) and learn about computed properties.
	> [!TIP]
	> 
	> Here is another short video where the concepts we examined – [[Computed Properties|how to create and use computed properties]] – are explained again.

## Things to do before our next class
