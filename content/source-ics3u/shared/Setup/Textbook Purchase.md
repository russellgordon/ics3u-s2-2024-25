The textbook is [SwiftUI Views Mastery](https://www.bigmountainstudio.com/views), authored by Mark Moeykens and published by Big Mountain Studio.

Mr. Gordon will distribute a sheet for signatures in today's class; this indicates your understanding that your family's account will be charged for the textbook purchase.

The total cost will be $47.50 (Canadian).

> [!TIP]
> 
> By purchasing through the school (which makes a bulk purchase on behalf of all students enrolled in the course) your family will be obtaining this title for 40% less than the cost of purchasing on your own, directly from the publisher.
