Lakefield College School welcomes students from over 40 countries around the world this year.

This diversity is one of Mr. Gordon's favourite reasons to teach here.

Many students speak multiple languages and it is natural that a given student may feel more comfortable reading in one language or another.

If that describes you â€“ please feel free to use the translation features built into web browsers and operating systems.

Over time, Mr. Gordon has received feedback that the translations built into macOS and available through the Safari web browser tend to be most reliable.

This ultra short video shows you how to enable these translation services:
