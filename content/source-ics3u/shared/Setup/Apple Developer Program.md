To use [[Xcodes]] and load software on to an iPhone or iPad directly from your Mac, you need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program.

This membership also allows you to distribute builds of software you write through [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com), so your friends and family can try out your app and provide feedback.

Your membership is provided for you through Lakefield College School.
