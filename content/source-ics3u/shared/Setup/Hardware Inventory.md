To help Mr. Gordon ensure that every student is positioned for success this year, please create a new blank portfolio entry [on Notion](https://notion.so). Name the new entry **About my Mac**.

Then, please copy-paste a screenshot of the **About This Mac** dialog from your computer into the entry.

Here's how to do that:

1. From the  menu, select **About This Mac**.
2. When the dialog appears, press these keys at the same time to change the cursor into crosshairs: **Command-Shift-4**.
3. Then, press the **Spacebar** to change the crosshairs into a camera.
4. Finally, hold the **Control** key down, then use your mouse or trackpad to click the **About This Mac** dialog box. You now have a screenshot of that window in your computer's clipboard.
5. To finish up, go to Notion, place your cursor in the blank portfolio entry you created, and press **Command-V** to paste in the screenshot.

You should have something like this, once you are done:
