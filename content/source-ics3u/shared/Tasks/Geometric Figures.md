## Objective

Use a structure to model a 2D or 3D figure.

## Purpose

An opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of how to use stored properties and computed properties.

## Success criteria

- [ ] you created an [[Xcode Playgrounds|Xcode playground]] named **GeometricFigures**
- [ ] for your [[figures-formulas-and-assignments.pdf|assigned 2D or 3D figure]] , you:
	- [ ] authored a structure that stores key measurement(s)
	- [ ] authored a structure that computes:
		- [ ] the area and perimeter (for 2D figures), or...
		- [ ] the surface area and volume (for 3D figures)
		- [ ] where applicable, other measurements (for example, a circle with a radius of 5 units could compute it's diameter as 10 units)
	- [ ] wrote code that adheres to [[Code Style Conventions| established code style conventions]]
- [ ] you performed manual calculations for at least one instance of your figure on paper
- [ ] took a clear photograph or screenshot of those calculations and included that in your portfolio post for this task [on Notion](https://notion.so)
- [ ] you created instance(s) of the structure in the Xcode playground to verify that your code produces the same results as your calculations made on paper
- [ ] made a portfolio post to share your completed work

## Exemplar

Mr. Gordon was assigned the circle for this task.

Here are his manual calculations:
