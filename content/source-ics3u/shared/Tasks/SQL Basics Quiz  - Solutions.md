10. What is the primary purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)? Provide a brief explanation.

*Here are three plausible answers....*

**Answer 1:** 

The main job of a Database Management System (DBMS) is to organize, store, and manage data in a way that makes it easy to access, update, and secure. It helps users find and modify information quickly, without having to deal with all the complex details of the storage.
    
**Answer 2:**

A DBMS is software that helps manage large amounts of data. It allows users to add, remove, or search for information in an organized way, and ensures that the data is protected and consistent.

**Answer 3**
A DBMS is different from spreadsheets because it helps organize and manage large amounts of data more easily. While spreadsheets can become confusing with a lot of information, a DBMS makes sure the data is structured properly and easy to access. It also includes features for keeping the data safe and making sure everything stays accurate, which spreadsheets don’t offer. A DBMS is better for handling more complex data needs, like tracking relationships between different sets of information.
