## Objective 

The objective of this exercise is to activate your prior knowledge of these topics from earlier in the course:

- [[Data Types|data types]]
- [[Structures|structures]]
- [[Operators|operators]] and computed properties (as from the [[Geometric Figures]] task)
- user interface design / layouts [[Block Layouts|using]] [[Block Layouts, Part 2|stacks]]
- [[Lists|lists]] and [[Abstraction Using Lists|abstraction]]
- [[Navigation to a Detail View|navigation]]

## Context

Let's review these concepts by imagining that we have been hired to author an app to complement the weekly flyer that is produced by a chain of grocery stores to advertise on-sale items:

![[CG_2025_01_Jan3-9_LR.pdf]]

The client who has hired you and your partner gave very little direction regarding how the app should work, other than the following:

> Users should be able to scroll through a list of departments that have items for sale, just like they can flip through our flyer now. They should be able to navigate down to the on-sale items within each department. Make sure they can see the pictures and price of each on-sale item clearly.

## Getting started

Make a new iOS project in Xcode named **GroceryStoreFlyer**:

![[Pasted image 20250106195056.png]]

Be sure that source control is enabled:

![[Pasted image 20250106195127.png]]

Then switch to the Source Control navigator using **Command-2** and create a remote:

![[Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 7.52.53 PM.png]]

Then switch the Project navigator, right-click on the top-most blue folder, choose **Convert to Group**, and finally create new groups named **Views** and **Model**, arranging your project to look like this:

![[Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 7.58.09 PM.png]]

```

## Create a data model

You know that most apps simply provide a convenient way for their users to interact with data – to *see* data – and to *create new data*.

You might begin by designing the following structures – recall we can nest structures:

```swift
struct Flyer {
    let departments: [Department]
}

struct Department: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let name: String
    let items: [FoodItem]
}

struct FoodItem: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let name: String
    let image: String
}
```

Here, you are saying that:

- a given flyer will contain multiple departments (a *list* or array of departments)
	- each department has:
		- a unique identifier
		- a name
		- multiple food items (a *list* or array of food items)
	- each food item has:
		- a unique identifier
		- a name
		- a reference to the file name of an image stored in the `Assets` folder of your Xcode project

## Create example data

Studying the flyer provided earlier, you might then begin to create instances of your structures:

```swift
let thisWeeksFlyer = Flyer(
    
    departments: [
        
        Department(
            name: "Butcher's Best",
            items: [
                FoodItem(
                    name: "Sirloin Tip Oven Roasts",
                    image: "sirloin-tips"
                ),
                FoodItem(
                    name: "Porkloin Back Ribs",
                    image: "porkloin-back-ribs"
                ),
            ]
        ),

        Department(
            name: "Seafood",
            items: [
                FoodItem(
                    name: "Wild Pacific Halibut Fillets",
                    image: "wild-pacific-halibut-fillets"
                ),
                FoodItem(
                    name: "Wild Sockeye Salmon Fillets",
                    image: "wild-sockeye-salmon-fillets"
                ),
                FoodItem(
                    name: "Clam Chowder",
                    image: "clam-chowder"
                ),
            ]
        ),
        
        
    ]
)
```

## Exercises

> [!REMINDER]

> Be sure that you [[Pushing Commits|commit and push your work]] frequently as you make progress on this exercise with your partner.

### Basic navigation

To begin with, by working with your partner, referring to any prior lesson, or your own previously written code, see if you can extend your project so that it is organized to have files and folders along these lines:

![[Pasted image 20250108075209.png]]

The app itself should work something like this:

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
	<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1044508910?h=750a34df9b&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&portrait=0&byline=0&title=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Opening the Teamspace">
	</iframe>
	</div>
<script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

> [!TIP]
> 
> At first, don't worry about adding images. Just get the scrollable lists and navigation working.
> 
> Later, search the web and find images for the food items you choose to include in your example data. The images found do not need to exactly match those shown in the flyer above.
> 
> It is recommended that you search for images using the DuckDuckGo search engine in the Safari web browser – this usually ensures files you find are in the JPEG file format (.jpg) which is one of the supported image file types in an Xcode project. Please note that the WebP image format (.webp) is not supported by Xcode.

### Extend the model

Reconsider the data model.

Currently, the app does not capture all of the information a customer would find useful, such as prices or other additional information.

Extend the data model to include that missing information, then show that information in your app's user interface.

### Improve the user interface

After improving the data model, aim to better reproduce the look and feel of the grocery store flyer, but in digital form.

> [!HINT]
> 
> Use stacks or overlays to make the price appear over top of the image of a food item, for example. Change the font to better match the example flyer.

### Use computed properties

How might you use computed properties?

For example – what is a common method by which customers will comparison shop to find the lowest prices? Can your app help customers to do that?

Make necessary changes to your app's data model and views to show this information.
