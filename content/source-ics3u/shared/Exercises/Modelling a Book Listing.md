On day 3 of this first thread of the course, you [[Structures#Exercise|completed an exercise to design a data structure that would model a hockey card]].  

The next day, we talked about some key questions one should ask when designing such a structure.

These questions include:

- What stored properties need to be included to accurately model the item in question?
- How should properties be named?
- What data types should we use?

This process of designing a data structure [[Defining and Using Structures|was later summarized in a follow-up video]].

## Exercise

Work with a partner using the [[Driver-Navigator Pattern|driver-navigator pattern]].

Author a data structure named `BookListing`.

Follow established [[Code Style Conventions|code style conventions]].

Your data structure should have a property to keep track of all information shown within the blue box:

> [!TIP]
> 
> As you author the data structure, review the book listing for repeated information.
> 
> Is there any potential to use a second structure – like we did when authoring the `StatisticsLine` structure that was used within the `HockeyCard` structure?

When you are finished, please make a post [on Notion](https://notion.so) to share the work you and your partner completed.
