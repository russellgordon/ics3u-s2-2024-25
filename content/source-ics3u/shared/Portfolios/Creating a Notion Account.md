# Introducing Notion

## What is Notion?

Notion is a combination of traditional note-taking software and something called a database.

## How will we use Notion?

For our purposes, Notion is a great platform for two things:

1. Sharing evidence of your developing mastery of [[Learning Goals|course learning goals]].
2. Taking notes on the things you do not want to forget.
