Referring back to our [course outline](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qBRTN-AjrFhCuNItfIOblKPqq7hqgkkC/view?usp=share_link):

A given entry in your portfolio may provide evidence that you have made progress toward mastery of one or more learning goals.

Across a year, your portfolio should contain many entries for every learning goal. By doing so, this demonstrates your overall mastery of the course.

Tag your portfolio entries with the [[Learning Goals|learning goal(s)]] you think fit best.

Mr. Gordon will provide feedback, as needed.

For example, sometimes your entry has all the evidence you need, and the tags you selected are appropriate. Mr. Gordon will confirm this.

Sometimes a portfolio entry is tagged with the correct learning goal, but lacks sufficient evidence. Mr. Gordon will gently prompt you to provide the missing evidence.

Here is an ultra brief video showing how to select a learning goal for a portfolio entry:

> [!TIP]
> 
> Once your portfolio has many entries, it can become a bit more cumbersome to navigate. Using tags makes it easy to filter your portfolio by learning goal. This can help you when discussing your progress with Mr. Gordon during portfolio reviews, or to determine, as the year goes on, what learning goals you need to make more progress against.
