Here a sports analogy.

Imagine that you are part of a soccer team.

Your coach leads your team through all sorts of exercises while training, to help you and your teammates improve.

A huge part of that process, for the coach, is being able to see your progress on the pitch, and provide you with regular feedback.

For you as a player, the key is to accept that you will have great days and hard days, and to know that all feedback given to you by your coach is there to help you grow. By acting on that feedback, you get better!

That's essentially how portfolios work in this course.

The idea is to simply share how things went in the most recent class for you, good or bad.

Mr. Gordon will provide feedback to you.

Here is an example of what a completed portfolio entry might look like:
