[Pair programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html) is part of the broader umbrella of _Agile_ approaches to writing software. This post describes the *driver-navigator* pattern, which is one form of paired programming.

![[Pasted image 20240917213129.png]]

The *driver* is the person at the wheel – hands on the keyboard – she focuses on implementing the current to-do item – and talks through what she is doing while she does it.

The *navigator* is an active observer – she keeps an eye on the larger picture – watches carefully as the driver writes code – possibly pointing out errors as they occur – and also keeps the “big picture” goals in mind.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> When using the driver-navigator paired programming pattern – there is only **one** computer open for each pair of programmers.
> 
> At the end of the pair programming session, each partner receives a complete copy of the code that was developed.
