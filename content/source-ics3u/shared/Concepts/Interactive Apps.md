This is a longer video, but it does have chapters so that if desired, you can review only certain parts of the tutorial:

- 00:00:00 Project Organization
- 00:04:06 Create a New View
- 00:06:40 Create a Model
- 00:10:14 Connect the Model to the View
- 00:13:13 Collect Input
- 00:17:22 Show Output
- 00:21:25 Show More Output
- 00:23:38 How to Restart the Preview Window
- 00:24:08 IPO: Input-Process-Output
- 00:25:56 Adding an Image
- 00:31:10 Conclusion and Next Steps

## Exercise

Now, return to the structure you created for the [[Geometric Figures]] task.

Using the same steps shown in the video above, make:

- a *model* file that contains your own 2D or 3D structure from [[Geometric Figures|the earlier task]]
- a *view* file that:
	- uses the structure as a stored property
	- provides a user interface (one or more sliders) to allow for input
	- shows output

The idea is to move forward from manually interacting with the structure in a playground, like we did last week:

![[Pasted image 20240923050608.png]]

... and instead, build an interactive app, like this, but for your own figure:

> Remember to commit and push your work as you go in Xcode, using the **Option-Command-C** keyboard shortcut. This was [first shown in the video at 19:13](https://vimeo.com/1015475836/8c4ea1d1f2?share=copy#t=0h19m13s). Good use of source control is part of [learning goal 2](https://ics3u-s2-2024-25.russellgordon.ca/Learning-Goals#2).

## Extension

Use the knowledge you developed by building [[Block Layouts|block]] [[Block Layouts, Part 2|layouts]] and [this reference on styling text views](https://sarunw.com/posts/swiftui-text-font/) to improve the user interface of the app. You might try applying [a bit of padding](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-control-spacing-around-individual-views-using-padding), too.

Your interface might look something like this, once you are done:

> [!TIP]

> Your improved interface need not look precisely like this â€“ this is just an example.
